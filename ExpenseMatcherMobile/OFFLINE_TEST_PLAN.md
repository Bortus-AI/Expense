5. Tap "Sync Now" button
6. Verify:
   - Sync status indicator shows "Syncing..."
   - Pending operations are sent to server
   - Receipts update to "synced" status
   - Sync queue clears

### 8. Conflict Resolution
**Objective**: Verify conflict resolution strategies work

**Test Steps**:
1. Create a receipt while offline
2. Modify the same receipt on another device/app instance
3. Restore network connection
4. Verify:
   - Conflict is detected
   - Appropriate conflict resolution strategy is applied
   - Data integrity is maintained

### 9. Storage Optimization
**Objective**: Verify storage optimization features work

**Test Steps**:
1. Use the app for an extended period with many receipts
2. Navigate to Settings > Storage Settings
3. Tap "Optimize Storage" button
4. Verify:
   - Expired cache items are removed
   - Storage usage decreases
   - App performance is maintained

### 10. Data Persistence
**Objective**: Verify data persists across app sessions

**Test Steps**:
1. Create several receipts while offline
2. Close and reopen the app
3. Navigate to Receipts list
4. Verify:
   - All receipts are still present
   - Sync status is preserved
   - No data loss occurred

## Edge Cases

### 1. Network Fluctuations
**Objective**: Verify app handles intermittent connectivity

**Test Steps**:
1. Rapidly switch between online/offline states
2. Perform receipt operations during each state
3. Verify:
   - App remains responsive
   - Data is not lost
   - Sync queue handles interruptions gracefully

### 2. Large Data Transfers
**Objective**: Verify app handles large data efficiently

**Test Steps**:
1. Create many receipts while offline
2. Restore network connection
3. Verify:
   - Sync process completes successfully
   - App remains responsive during sync
   - Memory usage is managed properly

### 3. App Updates
**Objective**: Verify data migration works with app updates

**Test Steps**:
1. Install app with initial database schema
2. Create receipts
3. Update app with new database schema
4. Verify:
   - Existing data is migrated correctly
   - No data loss occurs
   - App functions normally after update

## Performance Metrics

### 1. Sync Speed
- Target: Sync operations complete within 3 seconds for typical data
- Measurement: Time from sync trigger to completion

### 2. Storage Usage
- Target: App storage usage remains under 100MB for typical usage
- Measurement: Storage usage in Settings > Storage Settings

### 3. Battery Usage
- Target: Background sync has minimal impact on battery
- Measurement: Battery usage during extended sync operations

## Success Criteria
- All test scenarios pass without critical errors
- Data integrity is maintained in all scenarios
- User experience is seamless during offline/online transitions
- Performance metrics meet targets
