## Database Schema Evolution

### New Tables
```sql
-- Users table
users (
  id, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name,
  email_verified, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Companies table  
companies (
  id, name, domain, plan_type, created_at, updated_at
)

-- User-Company relationships
user_companies (
  id, user_id, company_id, role, status, created_at
)

-- Audit logs
audit_logs (
  id, user_id, company_id, action, table_name, 
  record_id, old_values, new_values, created_at
)
```

### Modified Tables
- Add `company_id` to: transactions, receipts, matches
- Add `created_by`, `updated_by` user tracking
- Add soft delete columns (`deleted_at`)

---

## API Architecture Changes

### Authentication Layer
```
/auth/register    POST   - User registration
/auth/login       POST   - User login
/auth/logout      POST   - User logout  
/auth/refresh     POST   - Token refresh
/auth/forgot      POST   - Password reset
```

### Company Management
```
/companies        GET    - List user's companies
/companies        POST   - Create company (admin)
/companies/:id    GET    - Get company details
/companies/:id    PUT    - Update company
/companies/:id/users GET - List company users
/companies/:id/invite POST - Invite user
```

### Enhanced Existing APIs
- All existing endpoints get company scoping
- User context added to all operations
- Role-based permission checks

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- **JWT Best Practices**: Short-lived access tokens, secure refresh tokens
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing, complexity requirements
- **Rate Limiting**: Login attempt throttling
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention

### Data Security
- **Company Isolation**: Strict data segregation
- **Role Validation**: Server-side permission checks
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data modifications
- **File Security**: Signed URLs for receipt access

---

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- **Indexing Strategy**: Optimize for company_id queries
- **Connection Pooling**: Handle increased concurrent users
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient data fetching patterns

### Frontend
- **Code Splitting**: Load features on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed receipt thumbnails
- **Caching Strategy**: API response caching
- **Progressive Loading**: Skeleton screens and pagination

---

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Setup
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: Full feature testing environment  
- **Production**: High-availability deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, e2e tests
- **Database Migrations**: Safe schema evolution
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature rollouts
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Authentication)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Multi-Company)**: 2-3 weeks  
- **Phase 3 (Export Features)**: 1-2 weeks
- **Phase 4 (Mobile App)**: 3-4 weeks

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 7-11 weeks
